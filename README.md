# Raycasting Project

## Overview
This project is a game development endeavor inspired by the classic Wolfenstein 3D. It focuses on implementing raycasting, a rendering technique used to create a pseudo-3D perspective in a 2D game environment. The goal is to build a basic game engine that demonstrates raycasting and allows the player to navigate a simple map.

## Features
- **Raycasting Engine:** Implements the fundamental mechanics of raycasting to simulate a 3D perspective using 2D grid-based maps.
- **Player Navigation:** The player can move and rotate their viewpoint within the map.
- **Collision Detection:** Ensures the player cannot walk through walls.
- **Basic Graphics:** Visual representation of walls and floor/ceiling differentiation.

## Goals
1. **Understand Raycasting:** Learn the mathematics and logic behind the raycasting technique.
2. **Game Logic Development:** Implement essential game features like movement, collision detection, and rendering.
3. **Interactive Map Design:** Create a simple and functional map layout for the player to explore.

## Implementation Details
### Coordinate System
- The coordinate system is defined with the origin (0, 0) at the top-left corner of the screen.
- The **x-axis** increases to the right, and the **y-axis** increases downward.

### Key Components
1. **Map Representation:**
   - A grid-based 2D array where each cell represents either a wall or empty space.
   - Example:
     ```
     1 1 1 1 1
     1 0 0 0 1
     1 0 1 0 1
     1 0 0 0 1
     1 1 1 1 1
     ```
     (`1` represents a wall, and `0` represents empty space).

2. **Raycasting Algorithm:**
   - Casts rays from the playerâ€™s viewpoint to determine the distance to walls.
   - Calculates the height of walls based on the distance to simulate depth perception.

3. **Player Controls:**
   - **Movement:** Forward, backward, and strafing left/right.
   - **Rotation:** Turning the view left or right to adjust the perspective.

4. **Rendering:**
   - Draws vertical slices of the walls based on the distance computed by raycasting.
   - Implements basic shading or color variation to enhance depth perception.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** C
- **Graphics Library:** Simple drawing or rendering library like SDL or similar.
- **Development Environment:** Any C-supported IDE or text editor with compiler.

## Challenges
- Implementing accurate collision detection.
- Optimizing raycasting calculations for performance.
- Creating a visually appealing environment within the constraints of the project.

## Future Improvements
- Add textures to walls for a more immersive experience.
- Implement enemies or other interactive objects in the environment.
- Enhance lighting and shading effects.
- Expand the map with more complex layouts and challenges.
